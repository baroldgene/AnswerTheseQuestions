<h1>Will Needs These Questions Answered!</h1>

<p>Thanks for checking out my new project. Here's how it works:</p>

<ol>
  <li>As I work on new JavaScript skills, I often hear/read/encounter new things that I don't understand.
  <li>I'll add those questions to the <b>'Issues'</b> section of the repository <a          href="https://github.com/wijohnst/AnswerTheseQuestions/issues">here</a>
  <li>If you can answer a question, create a fork of the repo and answer it in a markdown file
  <li>Name your markdown file like this: <b>[ issuenumber].md</b>
  <li> Submit a pull request with a message like this: <b>closes #[issue number]</b>
</ol>
