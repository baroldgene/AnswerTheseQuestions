<h1>Will Needs These Questions Answered!</h1>

<p>Thanks for checking out my new project. Here's how it works:</p>

<ol>
  <li>As I work on new JavaScript skills, I often hear/read/encounter new things that I don't understand.
  <li>I'll add those questions to the <b>'Issues'</b> section of the repository
  <li>If you can answer a question, create a fork of the repo and answer it in a markdown file
  <li><i>Name your markdown file like this:</i>
                    [ issuenumber] .md
  <li> Submit a pull request with a message about which issue you are responding to
</ol>
