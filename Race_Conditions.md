<h1>What are 'race conditions' in computer science?</h1>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>A<b>Race Condition</b> is:</p>
<p>an undesirable situation that occurs when a device or system attempts to perform two or more operations at the same time, but because of the nature of the device or system, the operations must be done in the proper sequence to be done correctly.</p>

<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>In some homes there are multiple light switches connected to a common ceiling light. When these types of circuits are used, the switch position becomes irrelevant. If the light is on, moving either switch from its current position turns the light off. Similarly, if the light is off, then moving either switch from its current position turns the light on.</p>
